              <h2>Hi! I'm Nick Jang</h2>
              <p> I am a student at Thinkful, studying web development, and I live in
                Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </p>
              <p>As a former fast food worker, things need to be in proper place, and
                there is always room for learning.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>For a short while, I worked at a fast food restaurant. I got to
              experience working in a real kitchen, although the equipment was for
              fast food. While cooking is fun, I also realized that I enjoy coding.
              Making things is so fun! I once wrote a script to organize files from a
              particular software. It was one of my first experiences in a professional
              environment. Developing tools was a pleasure.</p>
            <!--Link to Thinkful in new tab-->
            <p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">
                Thinkful</a>, I am learning about web development and continuing my
              education in software engineering! Before Thinkful, I had a short
              background in computer science and computer graphics.</p>
            <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a
              partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I enjoy working with other
              developers to build great software.</p>
