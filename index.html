              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>For a short while, I worked at a fast-food restaurant. I got to
                experience working in a real kitchen, although the equipment was for
                fast-food. While cooking is fun, I also realized that I enjoy coding.
                Making things is so fun! I once wrote a script to organize files for a
                software application. It was one of my first experiences in a professional
                environment. Developing tools was a pleasure.</p>
              <p>I've been in three developer roles: from an animation studio to a research
                group and finally to a startup! I've learned from leaders in different fields,
                worked in teams, and managed solo projects while reporting to my supervisors.
                Lastly, I'm a recent computer science graduate from the University of Pennsylvania,
                and I've taken my education further into web development at
                <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>.
              </p>
              <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or looking for a partner for a
                hackathon), please reach out! I enjoy working with other developers to build
                great software.</p>

              <p>I can provide full-stack applications built with React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, 
                JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as other miscellaneous skills and technologies. The 
                application playing above was inspired by the time I had to log my hours while working 
                at the fast-food restaurant. It is built with the tech stack mentioned above and uses 
                search and sorting algorithms and exciting queries. You find more info under the project 
                Logger App below.</p>
